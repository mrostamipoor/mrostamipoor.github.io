I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science Department at Stony Brook University, working in the Hexlab under the supervision of  [Dr. Michalis Polychronakis](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mikepo/). My research focuses on advancing cloud, Kubernetes, and software security. I design techniques to mitigate vulnerabilities such as data leakage and excessive permissions, while enhancing secret management and securing serverless platforms. I’ve developed tools like **KubeKeeper**, which protects Kubernetes Secrets through transparent encryption and fine-grained access control, and **LeakLess**, which uses selective in-memory encryption for developer-annotated sensitive data to mitigate memory disclosure vulnerabilities—including speculative execution attacks—in serverless environments.

In the area of software security and system hardening, I developed **Confine**, a binary analysis tool that automatically generates fine-grained Seccomp profiles by extracting system call argument values to help reduce container attack surfaces.

Prior to my Ph.D., I was the Head of Software Security at Sadad Electronic Payment Company, where I led a team of security engineers in penetration testing, secure coding, and enhancing the security of web and mobile applications.

I’m passionate about protecting user data and building secure systems, and I’m driven by the challenge of solving real-world cybersecurity problems. Outside of research, I love cooking, yoga, working out, and spending time with friends—it keeps me grounded and inspired.
