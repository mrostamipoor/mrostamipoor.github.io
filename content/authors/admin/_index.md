I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Stony Brook University, advised by [Dr. Michalis Polychronakis](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mikepo/), and a Security Researcher with over 10 years of combined research and industry experience in cloud, container, and application security. My work focuses on scalable defenses against data leakage in cloud-native and serverless environments, with expertise in program analysis, vulnerability discovery, and secure software design. I leverage Python, Go, Rust, Kubernetes, and CodeQL to design and implement security tools, applying them in projects on Kubernetes secret protection, serverless memory safety, and container hardening—translating cutting-edge research into practical security solutions.

. I have a proven record of building tools for Kubernetes secret protection, serverless memory safety, and container hardening—translating cutting-edge research into practical security solutions.

I designed and developed **KubeKeeper**, a framework that prevents Kubernetes Secret leakage by applying encryption and fine-grained access control. I also created **LeakLess**, a selective in-memory encryption approach for developer-annotated sensitive data in serverless platforms, mitigating memory disclosure and transient execution attacks.
In the area of software security and container hardening, I developed **Confine**, a binary analysis tool that automatically generates fine-grained Seccomp profiles by extracting system call argument values to help reduce container attack surfaces.

Prior to my Ph.D., I was the Head of Software Security at Sadad Electronic Payment Company, where I led a team of security engineers in penetration testing, secure coding, and enhancing the security of web and mobile applications.

I’m passionate about protecting user data and building secure systems, and I’m driven by the challenge of solving real-world cybersecurity problems. Outside of research, I love cooking, yoga, working out, and spending time with friends—it keeps me grounded and inspired.
