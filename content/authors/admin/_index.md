I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science Department at Stony Brook University, working in the HexLab under the supervision of  [Dr. Michalis Polychronakis](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mikepo/). My research focuses on advancing cloud and Kubernetes security, where I develop novel techniques to prevent data leakage, enhance secret management, and secure serverless environments. I have designed solutions to address vulnerabilities such as excessive permissions and memory leakage attacks, including speculative execution attacks, particularly in Kubernetes and serverless platforms.

In addition, my work involves designing binary analysis tools to reduce system attack surfaces through fine-grained system call filtering.

Prior to pursuing my Ph.D., I worked as a Senior Web Application Security Engineer at Sadad Electronic Payment Company, where I led penetration testing efforts and enhanced the security of web and mobile applications.
