abstract: "LeakLess is an approach for protecting secret data against memory disclosure vulnerabilities and transient execution attacks on serverless computing platforms that use language-level sandboxing to run untrusted code. LeakLess relies on selective in-memory encryption of developer-annotated sensitive data and addresses the limitations of previous selective data protection techniques by combining in-memory encryption with a separate I/O module. This enables the safe transmission of protected data between serverless functions and external hosts. We implemented LeakLess on the Spin serverless platform and evaluated it with real-world serverless applications. Our results demonstrate that LeakLess provides robust protection while incurring only a minor throughput decreaseâ€”up to 2.8% when the I/O module runs on a different host than the Spin runtime, and up to 8.5% when it runs on the same host."
